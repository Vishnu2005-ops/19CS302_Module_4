# EX 16 C Program to perform bitwise OR operation of two integers. 

## AIM:
To write a C Program to perform bitwise OR operation of two integers. 

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Input two integers: a and b
3. Perform bitwise OR operation: result = a | b
4. Display the result
5. End

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    printf("Bitwise-OR result is = %d", a|b);
    return 0;
}
```

## Output:
